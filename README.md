A database containing information about soccer teams and the matches they've played in the file `database.sqlite`. For this project, the goal is to get the relevant data from this SQL database and do some calculations and data transformation. The final step entails a bit of OOP with a view to similar information extracting efforts in the future. 

The SQL database for this project comes from this [kaggle page](https://www.kaggle.com/laudanum/footballdelphi).
